# News App

## Description

This application is created to get the latest news from various sourse, and I have used MERN stack technology. Right now there won't be any data base integration, directly consumed external api to get the news. 

## How to start the application

This application uses the API KEY to access the news from external source, you can create your own api key from https://newsapi.org/. and once you get the api key. create a new folder in the root of the project and name it as config then inside the config folder create a new file called config.env. Below is an example 

Folder & File looks like this: config/config.env
Inside the config.env: NEWS_API_KEY=<YOUR_API_KEY>

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

This command runs the node and react app simultaneously. Then it opens the browser with http://localhost:3000.
